# fredrik.studio
A new version of my photography website, this time made with Nuxt.

The point of this version of the website is to create a edge hosted version, completely relying on modern solutions to host the website. 

## Images
This website feaures loading images from cloudflares edge servers. Images are loaded in different variants depending on the use case. All variants are served by cloudflare images. 

To keep track of which images belong to which album a firebase firestore is used.
