# fredrik.studio
A new version of my photography website, this time made with Nuxt. ⛰️

The point of this version of the website is to create a edge hosted version, completely relying on modern solutions from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Images
Like in my [other photography website](https://github.com/fredrikburmester/fredrikburmester-express), image loading is a top priority. That's why this time i've tried to decentralize and use Cloudflare to deliver my photos. 

### Cloudflare ☁️
Images are stored and loaded from Cloudflare Images. Images are loaded in different variants depending on the use case. 

### Firebase 🔥
To keep track of which images belong to which album a firebase firestore is used.
